SLAVERY AND ESCAPE'</li><li>'That evil influence which carried me first away from my father’s'</li><li>'house—which hurried me into the wild and indigested notion of raising'</li><li>'my fortune, and that impressed those conceits so forcibly upon me as to'</li><li>'make me deaf to all good advice, and to the entreaties and even the'</li><li>'commands of my father—I say, the same influence, whatever it was,'</li><li>'presented the most unfortunate of all enterprises to my view; and I'</li><li>'went on board a vessel bound to the coast of Africa; or, as our sailors'</li><li>'vulgarly called it, a voyage to Guinea.'</li><li>'It was my great misfortune that in all these adventures I did not ship'</li><li>'myself as a sailor; when, though I might indeed have worked a little'</li><li>'harder than ordinary, yet at the same time I should have learnt the'</li><li>'duty and office of a fore-mast man, and in time might have qualified'</li><li>'myself for a mate or lieutenant, if not for a master. But as it was'</li><li>'always my fate to choose for the worse, so I did here; for having money'</li><li>'in my pocket and good clothes upon my back, I would always go on board'</li><li>'in the habit of a gentleman; and so I neither had any business in the'</li><li>'ship, nor learned to do any.'</li><li>'It was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good company in London,'</li><li>'which does not always happen to such loose and misguided young fellows'</li><li>'as I then was; the devil generally not omitting to lay some snare for'</li><li>'them very early; but it was not so with me. I first got acquainted with'</li><li>'the master of a ship who had been on the coast of Guinea; and who,'</li><li>'having had very good success there, was resolved to go again. This'</li><li>'captain taking a fancy to my conversation, which was not at all'</li><li>'disagreeable at that time, hearing me say I had a mind to see the'</li><li>'world, told me if I would go the voyage with him I should be at no'</li><li>'expense; I should be his messmate and his companion; and if I could'</li><li>'carry anything with me, I should have all the advantage of it that the'</li><li>'trade would admit; and perhaps I might meet with some encouragement.'</li><li>'I embraced the offer; and entering into a strict friendship with this'</li><li>'captain, who was an honest, plain-dealing man, I went the voyage with'</li><li>'him, and carried a small adventure with me, which, by the disinterested'</li><li>'honesty of my friend the captain, I increased very considerably; for I'</li><li>'carried about £40 in such toys and trifles as the captain directed me'</li><li>'to buy. These £40 I had mustered together by the assistance of some of'</li><li>'my relations whom I corresponded with; and who, I believe, got my'</li><li>'father, or at least my mother, to contribute so much as that to my'</li><li>'first adventure.'</li><li>'This was the only voyage which I may say was successful in all my'</li><li>'adventures, which I owe to the integrity and honesty of my friend the'</li><li>'captain; under whom also I got a competent knowledge of the mathematics'</li><li>'and the rules of navigation, learned how to keep an account of the'</li><li>'ship’s course, take an observation, and, in short, to understand some'</li><li>'things that were needful to be understood by a sailor; for, as he took'</li><li>'delight to instruct me, I took delight to learn; and, in a word, this'</li><li>'voyage made me both a sailor and a merchant; for I brought home five'</li><li>'pounds nine ounces of gold-dust for my adventure, which yielded me in'</li><li>'London, at my return, almost £300; and this filled me with those'</li><li>'aspiring thoughts which have since so completed my ruin.'</li><li>'Yet even in this voyage I had my misfortunes too; particularly, that I'</li><li>'was continually sick, being thrown into a violent calenture by the'</li><li>'excessive heat of the climate; our principal trading being upon the'</li><li>'coast, from latitude of 15 degrees north even to the line itself.'</li><li>'I was now set up for a Guinea trader; and my friend, to my great'</li><li>'misfortune, dying soon after his arrival, I resolved to go the same'</li><li>'voyage again, and I embarked in the same vessel with one who was his'</li><li>'mate in the former voyage, and had now got the command of the ship.'</li><li>'This was the unhappiest voyage that ever man made; for though I did not'</li><li>'carry quite £100 of my new-gained wealth, so that I had £200 left,'</li><li>'which I had lodged with my friend’s widow, who was very just to me, yet'</li><li>'I fell into terrible misfortunes. The first was this: our ship making'</li><li>'her course towards the Canary Islands, or rather between those islands'</li><li>'and the African shore, was surprised in the grey of the morning by a'</li><li>'Turkish rover of Sallee, who gave chase to us with all the sail she'</li><li>'could make. We crowded also as much canvas as our yards would spread,'</li><li>'or our masts carry, to get clear; but finding the pirate gained upon'</li><li>'us, and would certainly come up with us in a few hours, we prepared to'</li><li>'fight; our ship having twelve guns, and the rogue eighteen. About three'</li><li>'in the afternoon he came up with us, and bringing to, by mistake, just'</li><li>'athwart our quarter, instead of athwart our stern, as he intended, we'</li><li>'brought eight of our guns to bear on that side, and poured in a'</li><li>'broadside upon him, which made him sheer off again, after returning our'</li><li>'fire, and pouring in also his small shot from near two hundred men'</li><li>'which he had on board. However, we had not a man touched, all our men'</li><li>'keeping close. He prepared to attack us again, and we to defend'</li><li>'ourselves. But laying us on board the next time upon our other quarter,'</li><li>'he entered sixty men upon our decks, who immediately fell to cutting'</li><li>'and hacking the sails and rigging. We plied them with small shot,'</li><li>'half-pikes, powder-chests, and such like, and cleared our deck of them'</li><li>'twice. However, to cut short this melancholy part of our story, our'</li><li>'ship being disabled, and three of our men killed, and eight wounded, we'</li><li>'were obliged to yield, and were carried all prisoners into Sallee, a'</li><li>'port belonging to the Moors.'</li><li>'The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at first I apprehended;'</li><li>'nor was I carried up the country to the emperor’s court, as the rest of'</li><li>'our men were, but was kept by the captain of the rover as his proper'</li><li>'prize, and made his slave, being young and nimble, and fit for his'</li><li>'business. At this surprising change of my circumstances, from a'</li><li>'merchant to a miserable slave, I was perfectly overwhelmed; and now I'</li><li>'looked back upon my father’s prophetic discourse to me, that I should'</li><li>'be miserable and have none to relieve me, which I thought was now so'</li><li>'effectually brought to pass that I could not be worse; for now the hand'</li><li>'of Heaven had overtaken me, and I was undone without redemption; but,'</li><li>'alas! this was but a taste of the misery I was to go through, as will'</li><li>'appear in the sequel of this story.'</li><li>'As my new patron, or master, had taken me home to his house, so I was'</li><li>'in hopes that he would take me with him when he went to sea again,'</li><li>'believing that it would some time or other be his fate to be taken by a'</li><li>'Spanish or Portugal man-of-war; and that then I should be set at'</li><li>'liberty. But this hope of mine was soon taken away; for when he went to'</li><li>'sea, he left me on shore to look after his little garden, and do the'</li><li>'common drudgery of slaves about his house; and when he came home again'</li><li>'from his cruise, he ordered me to lie in the cabin to look after the'</li><li>'ship.'</li><li>'Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and what method I might take to'</li><li>'effect it, but found no way that had the least probability in it;'</li><li>'nothing presented to make the supposition of it rational; for I had'</li><li>'nobody to communicate it to that would embark with me—no fellow-slave,'</li><li>'no Englishman, Irishman, or Scotchman there but myself; so that for two'</li><li>'years, though I often pleased myself with the imagination, yet I never'</li><li>'had the least encouraging prospect of putting it in practice.'</li><li>'After about two years, an odd circumstance presented itself, which put'</li><li>'the old thought of making some attempt for my liberty again in my head.'</li><li>'My patron lying at home longer than usual without fitting out his ship,'</li><li>'which, as I heard, was for want of money, he used constantly, once or'</li><li>'twice a week, sometimes oftener if the weather was fair, to take the'</li><li>'ship’s pinnace and go out into the road a-fishing; and as he always'</li><li>'took me and young Maresco with him to row the boat, we made him very'</li><li>'merry, and I proved very dexterous in catching fish; insomuch that'</li><li>'sometimes he would send me with a Moor, one of his kinsmen, and the'</li><li>'youth—the Maresco, as they called him—to catch a dish of fish for him.'</li><li>'It happened one time, that going a-fishing in a calm morning, a fog'</li><li>'rose so thick that, though we were not half a league from the shore, we'</li><li>'lost sight of it; and rowing we knew not whither or which way, we'</li><li>'laboured all day, and all the next night; and when the morning came we'</li><li>'found we had pulled off to sea instead of pulling in for the shore; and'</li><li>'that we were at least two leagues from the shore. However, we got well'</li><li>'in again, though with a great deal of labour and some danger; for the'</li><li>'wind began to blow pretty fresh in the morning; but we were all very'</li><li>'hungry.'</li><li>'But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to take more care of'</li><li>'himself for the future; and having lying by him the longboat of our'</li><li>'English ship that he had taken, he resolved he would not go a-fishing'</li><li>'any more without a compass and some provision; so he ordered the'</li><li>'carpenter of his ship, who also was an English slave, to build a little'</li><li>'state-room, or cabin, in the middle of the long-boat, like that of a'</li><li>'barge, with a place to stand behind it to steer, and haul home the'</li><li>'main-sheet; the room before for a hand or two to stand and work the'</li><li>'sails. She sailed with what we call a shoulder-of-mutton sail; and the'</li><li>'boom jibed over the top of the cabin, which lay very snug and low, and'</li><li>'had in it room for him to lie, with a slave or two, and a table to eat'</li><li>'on, with some small lockers to put in some bottles of such liquor as he'</li><li>'thought fit to drink; and his bread, rice, and coffee.'</li><li>'We went frequently out with this boat a-fishing; and as I was most'</li><li>'dexterous to catch fish for him, he never went without me. It happened'</li><li>'that he had appointed to go out in this boat, either for pleasure or'</li><li>'for fish, with two or three Moors of some distinction in that place,'</li><li>'and for whom he had provided extraordinarily, and had, therefore, sent'</li><li>'on board the boat overnight a larger store of provisions than ordinary;'</li><li>'and had ordered me to get ready three fusees with powder and shot,'</li><li>'which were on board his ship, for that they designed some sport of'</li><li>'fowling as well as fishing.'</li><li>'I got all things ready as he had directed, and waited the next morning'</li><li>'with the boat washed clean, her ancient and pendants out, and'</li><li>'everything to accommodate his guests; when by-and-by my patron came on'</li><li>'board alone, and told me his guests had put off going from some'</li><li>'business that fell out, and ordered me, with the man and boy, as usual,'</li><li>'to go out with the boat and catch them some fish, for that his friends'</li><li>'were to sup at his house, and commanded that as soon as I got some fish'</li><li>'I should bring it home to his house; all which I prepared to do.'</li><li>'This moment my former notions of deliverance darted into my thoughts,'</li><li>'for now I found I was likely to have a little ship at my command; and'</li><li>'my master being gone, I prepared to furnish myself, not for fishing'</li><li>'business, but for a voyage; though I knew not, neither did I so much as'</li><li>'consider, whither I should steer—anywhere to get out of that place was'</li><li>'my desire.'</li><li>'My first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to this Moor, to'</li><li>'get something for our subsistence on board; for I told him we must not'</li><li>'presume to eat of our patron’s bread. He said that was true; so he'</li><li>'brought a large basket of rusk or biscuit, and three jars of fresh'</li><li>'water, into the boat. I knew where my patron’s case of bottles stood,'</li><li>'which it was evident, by the make, were taken out of some English'</li><li>'prize, and I conveyed them into the boat while the Moor was on shore,'</li><li>'as if they had been there before for our master. I conveyed also a'</li><li>'great lump of beeswax into the boat, which weighed about half a'</li><li>'hundred-weight, with a parcel of twine or thread, a hatchet, a saw, and'</li><li>'a hammer, all of which were of great use to us afterwards, especially'</li><li>'the wax, to make candles. Another trick I tried upon him, which he'</li><li>'innocently came into also: his name was Ismael, which they call Muley,'</li><li>'or Moely; so I called to him—“Moely,” said I, “our patron’s guns are on'</li><li>'board the boat; can you not get a little powder and shot? It may be we'</li><li>'may kill some alcamies (a fowl like our curlews) for ourselves, for I'</li><li>'know he keeps the gunner’s stores in the ship.” “Yes,” says he, “I’ll'</li><li>'bring some;” and accordingly he brought a great leather pouch, which'</li><li>'held a pound and a half of powder, or rather more; and another with'</li><li>'shot, that had five or six pounds, with some bullets, and put all into'</li><li>'the boat. At the same time I had found some powder of my master’s in'</li><li>'the great cabin, with which I filled one of the large bottles in the'</li><li>'case, which was almost empty, pouring what was in it into another; and'</li><li>'thus furnished with everything needful, we sailed out of the port to'</li><li>'fish. The castle, which is at the entrance of the port, knew who we'</li><li>'were, and took no notice of us; and we were not above a mile out of the'</li><li>'port before we hauled in our sail and set us down to fish. The wind'</li><li>'blew from the N.N.E., which was contrary to my desire, for had it blown'</li><li>'southerly I had been sure to have made the coast of Spain, and at least'</li><li>'reached to the bay of Cadiz; but my resolutions were, blow which way it'</li><li>'would, I would be gone from that horrid place where I was, and leave'</li><li>'the rest to fate.'</li><li>'After we had fished some time and caught nothing—for when I had fish on'</li><li>'my hook I would not pull them up, that he might not see them—I said to'</li><li>'the Moor, “This will not do; our master will not be thus served; we'</li><li>'must stand farther off.” He, thinking no harm, agreed, and being in the'</li><li>'head of the boat, set the sails; and, as I had the helm, I ran the boat'</li><li>'out near a league farther, and then brought her to, as if I would fish;'</li><li>'when, giving the boy the helm, I stepped forward to where the Moor was,'</li><li>'and making as if I stooped for something behind him, I took him by'</li><li>'surprise with my arm under his waist, and tossed him clear overboard'</li><li>'into the sea. He rose immediately, for he swam like a cork, and called'</li><li>'to me, begged to be taken in, told me he would go all over the world'</li><li>'with me. He swam so strong after the boat that he would have reached me'</li><li>'very quickly, there being but little wind; upon which I stepped into'</li><li>'the cabin, and fetching one of the fowling-pieces, I presented it at'</li><li>'him, and told him I had done him no hurt, and if he would be quiet I'</li><li>'would do him none. “But,” said I, “you swim well enough to reach to the'</li><li>'shore, and the sea is calm; make the best of your way to shore, and I'</li><li>'will do you no harm; but if you come near the boat I’ll shoot you'</li><li>'through the head, for I am resolved to have my liberty;” so he turned'</li><li>'himself about, and swam for the shore, and I make no doubt but he'</li><li>'reached it with ease, for he was an excellent swimmer.'</li><li>'I could have been content to have taken this Moor with me, and have'</li><li>'drowned the boy, but there was no venturing to trust him. When he was'</li><li>'gone, I turned to the boy, whom they called Xury, and said to him,'</li><li>'“Xury, if you will be faithful to me, I’ll make you a great man; but if'</li><li>'you will not stroke your face to be true to me”—that is, swear by'</li><li>'Mahomet and his father’s beard—“I must throw you into the sea too.” The'</li><li>'boy smiled in my face, and spoke so innocently that I could not'</li><li>'distrust him, and swore to be faithful to me, and go all over the world'</li><li>'with me.'</li><li>'While I was in view of the Moor that was swimming, I stood out directly'</li><li>'to sea with the boat, rather stretching to windward, that they might'</li><li>'think me gone towards the Straits’ mouth (as indeed any one that had'</li><li>'been in their wits must have been supposed to do): for who would have'</li><li>'supposed we were sailed on to the southward, to the truly Barbarian'</li><li>'coast, where whole nations of negroes were sure to surround us with'</li><li>'their canoes and destroy us; where we could not go on shore but we'</li><li>'should be devoured by savage beasts, or more merciless savages of human'</li><li>'kind.'</li><li>'But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I changed my course, and'</li><li>'steered directly south and by east, bending my course a little towards'</li><li>'the east, that I might keep in with the shore; and having a fair, fresh'</li><li>'gale of wind, and a smooth, quiet sea, I made such sail that I believe'</li><li>'by the next day, at three o’clock in the afternoon, when I first made'</li><li>'the land, I could not be less than one hundred and fifty miles south of'</li><li>'Sallee; quite beyond the Emperor of Morocco’s dominions, or indeed of'</li><li>'any other king thereabouts, for we saw no people.'</li><li>'Yet such was the fright I had taken of the Moors, and the dreadful'</li><li>'apprehensions I had of falling into their hands, that I would not stop,'</li><li>'or go on shore, or come to an anchor; the wind continuing fair till I'</li><li>'had sailed in that manner five days; and then the wind shifting to the'</li><li>'southward, I concluded also that if any of our vessels were in chase of'</li><li>'me, they also would now give over; so I ventured to make to the coast,'</li><li>'and came to an anchor in the mouth of a little river, I knew not what,'</li><li>'nor where, neither what latitude, what country, what nation, or what'</li><li>'river. I neither saw, nor desired to see any people; the principal'</li><li>'thing I wanted was fresh water. We came into this creek in the evening,'</li><li>'resolving to swim on shore as soon as it was dark, and discover the'</li><li>'country; but as soon as it was quite dark, we heard such dreadful'</li><li>'noises of the barking, roaring, and howling of wild creatures, of we'</li><li>'knew not what kinds, that the poor boy was ready to die with fear, and'</li><li>'begged of me not to go on shore till day. “Well, Xury,” said I, “then I'</li><li>'won’t; but it may be that we may see men by day, who will be as bad to'</li><li>'us as those lions.” “Then we give them the shoot gun,” says Xury,'</li><li>'laughing, “make them run wey.” Such English Xury spoke by conversing'</li><li>'among us slaves. However, I was glad to see the boy so cheerful, and I'</li><li>'gave him a dram (out of our patron’s case of bottles) to cheer him up.'</li><li>'After all, Xury’s advice was good, and I took it; we dropped our little'</li><li>'anchor, and lay still all night; I say still, for we slept none; for in'</li><li>'two or three hours we saw vast great creatures (we knew not what to'</li><li>'call them) of many sorts, come down to the sea-shore and run into the'</li><li>'water, wallowing and washing themselves for the pleasure of cooling'</li><li>'themselves; and they made such hideous howlings and yellings, that I'</li><li>'never indeed heard the like.'</li><li>'Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was I too; but we were both'</li><li>'more frighted when we heard one of these mighty creatures come swimming'</li><li>'towards our boat; we could not see him, but we might hear him by his'</li><li>'blowing to be a monstrous huge and furious beast. Xury said it was a'</li><li>'lion, and it might be so for aught I know; but poor Xury cried to me to'</li><li>'weigh the anchor and row away; “No,” says I, “Xury; we can slip our'</li><li>'cable, with the buoy to it, and go off to sea; they cannot follow us'</li><li>'far.” I had no sooner said so, but I perceived the creature (whatever'</li><li>'it was) within two oars’ length, which something surprised me; however,'</li><li>'I immediately stepped to the cabin door, and taking up my gun, fired at'</li><li>'him; upon which he immediately turned about and swam towards the shore'</li><li>'again.'</li><li>'But it is impossible to describe the horrid noises, and hideous cries'</li><li>'and howlings that were raised, as well upon the edge of the shore as'</li><li>'higher within the country, upon the noise or report of the gun, a thing'</li><li>'I have some reason to believe those creatures had never heard before:'</li><li>'this convinced me that there was no going on shore for us in the night'</li><li>'on that coast, and how to venture on shore in the day was another'</li><li>'question too; for to have fallen into the hands of any of the savages'</li><li>'had been as bad as to have fallen into the hands of the lions and'</li><li>'tigers; at least we were equally apprehensive of the danger of it.'</li><li>'Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore somewhere or other'</li><li>'for water, for we had not a pint left in the boat; when and where to'</li><li>'get to it was the point. Xury said, if I would let him go on shore with'</li><li>'one of the jars, he would find if there was any water, and bring some'</li><li>'to me. I asked him why he would go? why I should not go, and he stay in'</li><li>'the boat? The boy answered with so much affection as made me love him'</li><li>'ever after. Says he, “If wild mans come, they eat me, you go wey.”'</li><li>'“Well, Xury,” said I, “we will both go and if the wild mans come, we'</li><li>'will kill them, they shall eat neither of us.” So I gave Xury a piece'</li><li>'of rusk bread to eat, and a dram out of our patron’s case of bottles'</li><li>'which I mentioned before; and we hauled the boat in as near the shore'</li><li>'as we thought was proper, and so waded on shore, carrying nothing but'</li><li>'our arms and two jars for water.'</li><li>'I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing the coming of'</li><li>'canoes with savages down the river; but the boy seeing a low place'</li><li>'about a mile up the country, rambled to it, and by-and-by I saw him'</li><li>'come running towards me. I thought he was pursued by some savage, or'</li><li>'frighted with some wild beast, and I ran forward towards him to help'</li><li>'him; but when I came nearer to him I saw something hanging over his'</li><li>'shoulders, which was a creature that he had shot, like a hare, but'</li><li>'different in colour, and longer legs; however, we were very glad of it,'</li><li>'and it was very good meat; but the great joy that poor Xury came with,'</li><li>'was to tell me he had found good water and seen no wild mans.'</li><li>'But we found afterwards that we need not take such pains for water, for'</li><li>'a little higher up the creek where we were we found the water fresh'</li><li>'when the tide was out, which flowed but a little way up; so we filled'</li><li>'our jars, and feasted on the hare he had killed, and prepared to go on'</li><li>'our way, having seen no footsteps of any human creature in that part of'</li><li>'the country.'</li><li>'As I had been one voyage to this coast before, I knew very well that'</li><li>'the islands of the Canaries, and the Cape de Verde Islands also, lay'</li><li>'not far off from the coast. But as I had no instruments to take an'</li><li>'observation to know what latitude we were in, and not exactly knowing,'</li><li>'or at least remembering, what latitude they were in, I knew not where'</li><li>'to look for them, or when to stand off to sea towards them; otherwise I'</li><li>'might now easily have found some of these islands. But my hope was,'</li><li>'that if I stood along this coast till I came to that part where the'</li><li>'English traded, I should find some of their vessels upon their usual'</li><li>'design of trade, that would relieve and take us in.'</li><li>'By the best of my calculation, that place where I now was must be that'</li><li>'country which, lying between the Emperor of Morocco’s dominions and the'</li><li>'negroes, lies waste and uninhabited, except by wild beasts; the negroes'</li><li>'having abandoned it and gone farther south for fear of the Moors, and'</li><li>'the Moors not thinking it worth inhabiting by reason of its barrenness;'</li><li>'and indeed, both forsaking it because of the prodigious number of'</li><li>'tigers, lions, leopards, and other furious creatures which harbour'</li><li>'there; so that the Moors use it for their hunting only, where they go'</li><li>'like an army, two or three thousand men at a time; and indeed for near'</li><li>'a hundred miles together upon this coast we saw nothing but a waste,'</li><li>'uninhabited country by day, and heard nothing but howlings and roaring'</li><li>'of wild beasts by night.'</li><li>'Once or twice in the daytime I thought I saw the Pico of Teneriffe,'</li><li>'being the high top of the Mountain Teneriffe in the Canaries, and had a'</li><li>'great mind to venture out, in hopes of reaching thither; but having'</li><li>'tried twice, I was forced in again by contrary winds, the sea also'</li><li>'going too high for my little vessel; so, I resolved to pursue my first'</li><li>'design, and keep along the shore.'</li><li>'Several times I was obliged to land for fresh water, after we had left'</li><li>'this place; and once in particular, being early in morning, we came to'</li><li>'an anchor under a little point of land, which was pretty high; and the'</li><li>'tide beginning to flow, we lay still to go farther in. Xury, whose eyes'</li><li>'were more about him than it seems mine were, calls softly to me, and'</li><li>'tells me that we had best go farther off the shore; “For,” says he,'</li><li>'“look, yonder lies a dreadful monster on the side of that hillock, fast'</li><li>'asleep.” I looked where he pointed, and saw a dreadful monster indeed,'</li><li>'for it was a terrible, great lion that lay on the side of the shore,'</li><li>'under the shade of a piece of the hill that hung as it were a little'</li><li>'over him. “Xury,” says I, “you shall on shore and kill him.” Xury,'</li><li>'looked frighted, and said, “Me kill! he eat me at one mouth!”—one'</li><li>'mouthful he meant. However, I said no more to the boy, but bade him lie'</li><li>'still, and I took our biggest gun, which was almost musket-bore, and'</li><li>'loaded it with a good charge of powder, and with two slugs, and laid it'</li><li>'down; then I loaded another gun with two bullets; and the third (for we'</li><li>'had three pieces) I loaded with five smaller bullets. I took the best'</li><li>'aim I could with the first piece to have shot him in the head, but he'</li><li>'lay so with his leg raised a little above his nose, that the slugs hit'</li><li>'his leg about the knee and broke the bone. He started up, growling at'</li><li>'first, but finding his leg broken, fell down again; and then got upon'</li><li>'three legs, and gave the most hideous roar that ever I heard. I was a'</li><li>'little surprised that I had not hit him on the head; however, I took up'</li><li>'the second piece immediately, and though he began to move off, fired'</li><li>'again, and shot him in the head, and had the pleasure to see him drop'</li><li>'and make but little noise, but lie struggling for life. Then Xury took'</li><li>'heart, and would have me let him go on shore. “Well, go,” said I: so'</li><li>'the boy jumped into the water and taking a little gun in one hand, swam'</li><li>'to shore with the other hand, and coming close to the creature, put the'</li><li>'muzzle of the piece to his ear, and shot him in the head again, which'</li><li>'despatched him quite.'</li><li>'This was game indeed to us, but this was no food; and I was very sorry'</li><li>'to lose three charges of powder and shot upon a creature that was good'</li><li>'for nothing to us. However, Xury said he would have some of him; so he'</li><li>'comes on board, and asked me to give him the hatchet. “For what, Xury?”'</li><li>'said I. “Me cut off his head,” said he. However, Xury could not cut off'</li><li>'his head, but he cut off a foot, and brought it with him, and it was a'</li><li>'monstrous great one.'</li><li>'I bethought myself, however, that, perhaps the skin of him might, one'</li><li>'way or other, be of some value to us; and I resolved to take off his'</li><li>'skin if I could. So Xury and I went to work with him; but Xury was much'</li><li>'the better workman at it, for I knew very ill how to do it. Indeed, it'</li><li>'took us both up the whole day, but at last we got off the hide of him,'</li><li>'and spreading it on the top of our cabin, the sun effectually dried it'</li><li>'in two days’ time, and it afterwards served me to lie upon.'</li></ol>\n"

       "\\item 'But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to take more care of'\n",
       "\\item 'himself for the future; and having lying by him the longboat of our'\n",
       "\\item 'English ship that he had taken, he resolved he would not go a-fishing'\n",
       "\\item 'any more without a compass and some provision; so he ordered the'\n",

       "\\item 'state-room, or cabin, in the middle of the long-boat, like that of a'\n",
       "\\item 'barge, with a place to stand behind it to steer, and haul home the'\n",
       "\\item 'main-sheet; the room before for a hand or two to stand and work the'\n",
       "\\item 'sails. She sailed with what we call a shoulder-of-mutton sail; and the'\n",

       "\\item 'We went frequently out with this boat a-fishing; and as I was most'\n",

       "\\item 'for fish, with two or three Moors of some distinction in that place,'\n",
       "\\item 'and for whom he had provided extraordinarily, and had, therefore, sent'\n",
       "\\item 'on board the boat overnight a larger store of provisions than ordinary;'\n",
       "\\item 'and had ordered me to get ready three fusees with powder and shot,'\n",
       "\\item 'which were on board his ship, for that they designed some sport of'\n",
       "\\item 'fowling as well as fishing.'\n",
       "\\item 'I got all things ready as he had directed, and waited the next morning'\n",
       "\\item 'with the boat washed clean, her ancient and pendants out, and'\n",
       "\\item 'everything to accommodate his guests; when by-and-by my patron came on'\n",
       "\\item 'board alone, and told me his guests had put off going from some'\n",
       "\\item 'business that fell out, and ordered me, with the man and boy, as usual,'\n",
       "\\item 'to go out with the boat and catch them some fish, for that his friends'\n",
       "\\item 'were to sup at his house, and commanded that as soon as I got some fish'\n",
       "\\item 'I should bring it home to his house; all which I prepared to do.'\n",
       "\\item 'This moment my former notions of deliverance darted into my thoughts,'\n",
       "\\item 'for now I found I was likely to have a little ship at my command; and'\n",
       "\\item 'my master being gone, I prepared to furnish myself, not for fishing'\n",
       "\\item 'business, but for a voyage; though I knew not, neither did I so much as'\n",
       "\\item 'consider, whither I should steer—anywhere to get out of that place was'\n",
       "\\item 'my desire.'\n",
       "\\item 'My first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to this Moor, to'\n",
       "\\item 'get something for our subsistence on board; for I told him we must not'\n",
       "\\item 'presume to eat of our patron’s bread. He said that was true; so he'\n",
       "\\item 'brought a large basket of rusk or biscuit, and three jars of fresh'\n",
       "\\item 'water, into the boat. I knew where my patron’s case of bottles stood,'\n",
       "\\item 'which it was evident, by the make, were taken out of some English'\n",
       "\\item 'prize, and I conveyed them into the boat while the Moor was on shore,'\n",
       "\\item 'as if they had been there before for our master. I conveyed also a'\n",
       "\\item 'great lump of beeswax into the boat, which weighed about half a'\n",
       "\\item 'hundred-weight, with a parcel of twine or thread, a hatchet, a saw, and'\n",
       "\\item 'a hammer, all of which were of great use to us afterwards, especially'\n",
       "\\item 'the wax, to make candles. Another trick I tried upon him, which he'\n",
       "\\item 'innocently came into also: his name was Ismael, which they call Muley,'\n",
       "\\item 'or Moely; so I called to him—“Moely,” said I, “our patron’s guns are on'\n",
       "\\item 'board the boat; can you not get a little powder and shot? It may be we'\n",
       "\\item 'may kill some alcamies (a fowl like our curlews) for ourselves, for I'\n",
       "\\item 'know he keeps the gunner’s stores in the ship.” “Yes,” says he, “I’ll'\n",
       "\\item 'bring some;” and accordingly he brought a great leather pouch, which'\n",
       "\\item 'held a pound and a half of powder, or rather more; and another with'\n",
       "\\item 'shot, that had five or six pounds, with some bullets, and put all into'\n",
       "\\item 'the boat. At the same time I had found some powder of my master’s in'\n",
       "\\item 'the great cabin, with which I filled one of the large bottles in the'\n",
       "\\item 'case, which was almost empty, pouring what was in it into another; and'\n",
       "\\item 'thus furnished with everything needful, we sailed out of the port to'\n",
       "\\item 'fish. The castle, which is at the entrance of the port, knew who we'\n",
       "\\item 'were, and took no notice of us; and we were not above a mile out of the'\n",
       "\\item 'port before we hauled in our sail and set us down to fish. The wind'\n",
       "\\item 'blew from the N.N.E., which was contrary to my desire, for had it blown'\n",
       "\\item 'southerly I had been sure to have made the coast of Spain, and at least'\n",
       "\\item 'reached to the bay of Cadiz; but my resolutions were, blow which way it'\n",
       "\\item 'would, I would be gone from that horrid place where I was, and leave'\n",
       "\\item 'the rest to fate.'\n",
       "\\item 'After we had fished some time and caught nothing—for when I had fish on'\n",
       "\\item 'my hook I would not pull them up, that he might not see them—I said to'\n",
       "\\item 'the Moor, “This will not do; our master will not be thus served; we'\n",
       "\\item 'must stand farther off.” He, thinking no harm, agreed, and being in the'\n",
       "\\item 'head of the boat, set the sails; and, as I had the helm, I ran the boat'\n",
       "\\item 'out near a league farther, and then brought her to, as if I would fish;'\n",
       "\\item 'when, giving the boy the helm, I stepped forward to where the Moor was,'\n",
       "\\item 'and making as if I stooped for something behind him, I took him by'\n",
       "\\item 'surprise with my arm under his waist, and tossed him clear overboard'\n",
       "\\item 'into the sea. He rose immediately, for he swam like a cork, and called'\n",
       "\\item 'to me, begged to be taken in, told me he would go all over the world'\n",
       "\\item 'with me. He swam so strong after the boat that he would have reached me'\n",
       "\\item 'very quickly, there being but little wind; upon which I stepped into'\n",
       "\\item 'the cabin, and fetching one of the fowling-pieces, I presented it at'\n",
       "\\item 'him, and told him I had done him no hurt, and if he would be quiet I'\n",

       "\\item 'themselves; and they made such hideous howlings and yellings, that I'\n",

       "\\item 'Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was I too; but we were both'\n",

       "\\item 'blowing to be a monstrous huge and furious beast. Xury said it was a'\n",
       "\\item 'lion, and it might be so for aught I know; but poor Xury cried to me to'\n",
       "\\item 'weigh the anchor and row away; “No,” says I, “Xury; we can slip our'\n",
       "\\item 'cable, with the buoy to it, and go off to sea; they cannot follow us'\n",
       "\\item 'far.” I had no sooner said so, but I perceived the creature (whatever'\n",
       "\\item 'it was) within two oars’ length, which something surprised me; however,'\n",
       "\\item 'I immediately stepped to the cabin door, and taking up my gun, fired at'\n",
       "\\item 'him; upon which he immediately turned about and swam towards the shore'\n",
       "\\item 'again.'\n",
       "\\item 'But it is impossible to describe the horrid noises, and hideous cries'\n",

       "\\item 'I have some reason to believe those creatures had never heard before:'\n",
       "\\item 'this convinced me that there was no going on shore for us in the night'\n",
       "\\item 'on that coast, and how to venture on shore in the day was another'\n",
       "\\item 'question too; for to have fallen into the hands of any of the savages'\n",
       "\\item 'had been as bad as to have fallen into the hands of the lions and'\n",
       "\\item 'tigers; at least we were equally apprehensive of the danger of it.'\n",
       "\\item 'Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore somewhere or other'\n",
       "\\item 'for water, for we had not a pint left in the boat; when and where to'\n",
       "\\item 'get to it was the point. Xury said, if I would let him go on shore with'\n",
       "\\item 'one of the jars, he would find if there was any water, and bring some'\n",
       "\\item 'to me. I asked him why he would go? why I should not go, and he stay in'\n",
       "\\item 'the boat? The boy answered with so much affection as made me love him'\n",
       "\\item 'ever after. Says he, “If wild mans come, they eat me, you go wey.”'\n",
       "\\item '“Well, Xury,” said I, “we will both go and if the wild mans come, we'\n",
       "\\item 'will kill them, they shall eat neither of us.” So I gave Xury a piece'\n",
       "\\item 'of rusk bread to eat, and a dram out of our patron’s case of bottles'\n",
       "\\item 'which I mentioned before; and we hauled the boat in as near the shore'\n",
       "\\item 'as we thought was proper, and so waded on shore, carrying nothing but'\n",
       "\\item 'our arms and two jars for water.'\n",
       "\\item 'I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing the coming of'\n",
       "\\item 'canoes with savages down the river; but the boy seeing a low place'\n",
       "\\item 'about a mile up the country, rambled to it, and by-and-by I saw him'\n",
       "\\item 'come running towards me. I thought he was pursued by some savage, or'\n",
       "\\item 'frighted with some wild beast, and I ran forward towards him to help'\n",
       "\\item 'him; but when I came nearer to him I saw something hanging over his'\n",
       "\\item 'shoulders, which was a creature that he had shot, like a hare, but'\n",
       "\\item 'different in colour, and longer legs; however, we were very glad of it,'\n",
       "\\item 'and it was very good meat; but the great joy that poor Xury came with,'\n",
       "\\item 'was to tell me he had found good water and seen no wild mans.'\n",
       "\\item 'But we found afterwards that we need not take such pains for water, for'\n",
       "\\item 'a little higher up the creek where we were we found the water fresh'\n",
       "\\item 'when the tide was out, which flowed but a little way up; so we filled'\n",
       "\\item 'our jars, and feasted on the hare he had killed, and prepared to go on'\n",
       "\\item 'our way, having seen no footsteps of any human creature in that part of'\n",
       "\\item 'the country.'\n",
       "\\item 'As I had been one voyage to this coast before, I knew very well that'\n",
       "\\item 'the islands of the Canaries, and the Cape de Verde Islands also, lay'\n",
       "\\item 'not far off from the coast. But as I had no instruments to take an'\n",
       "\\item 'observation to know what latitude we were in, and not exactly knowing,'\n",
       "\\item 'or at least remembering, what latitude they were in, I knew not where'\n",
       "\\item 'to look for them, or when to stand off to sea towards them; otherwise I'\n",
       "\\item 'might now easily have found some of these islands. But my hope was,'\n",
       "\\item 'that if I stood along this coast till I came to that part where the'\n",
       "\\item 'English traded, I should find some of their vessels upon their usual'\n",
       "\\item 'design of trade, that would relieve and take us in.'\n",
       "\\item 'By the best of my calculation, that place where I now was must be that'\n",
       "\\item 'country which, lying between the Emperor of Morocco’s dominions and the'\n",
       "\\item 'negroes, lies waste and uninhabited, except by wild beasts; the negroes'\n",
       "\\item 'having abandoned it and gone farther south for fear of the Moors, and'\n",
       "\\item 'the Moors not thinking it worth inhabiting by reason of its barrenness;'\n",
       "\\item 'and indeed, both forsaking it because of the prodigious number of'\n",
       "\\item 'tigers, lions, leopards, and other furious creatures which harbour'\n",
       "\\item 'there; so that the Moors use it for their hunting only, where they go'\n",
       "\\item 'like an army, two or three thousand men at a time; and indeed for near'\n",
       "\\item 'a hundred miles together upon this coast we saw nothing but a waste,'\n",
       "\\item 'uninhabited country by day, and heard nothing but howlings and roaring'\n",
       "\\item 'of wild beasts by night.'\n",
       "\\item 'Once or twice in the daytime I thought I saw the Pico of Teneriffe,'\n",
       "\\item 'being the high top of the Mountain Teneriffe in the Canaries, and had a'\n",
       "\\item 'great mind to venture out, in hopes of reaching thither; but having'\n",
       "\\item 'tried twice, I was forced in again by contrary winds, the sea also'\n",
       "\\item 'going too high for my little vessel; so, I resolved to pursue my first'\n",
       "\\item 'design, and keep along the shore.'\n",
       "\\item 'Several times I was obliged to land for fresh water, after we had left'\n",
       "\\item 'this place; and once in particular, being early in morning, we came to'\n",
       "\\item 'an anchor under a little point of land, which was pretty high; and the'\n",
       "\\item 'tide beginning to flow, we lay still to go farther in. Xury, whose eyes'\n",
       "\\item 'were more about him than it seems mine were, calls softly to me, and'\n",
       "\\item 'tells me that we had best go farther off the shore; “For,” says he,'\n",
       "\\item '“look, yonder lies a dreadful monster on the side of that hillock, fast'\n",
       "\\item 'asleep.” I looked where he pointed, and saw a dreadful monster indeed,'\n",
       "\\item 'for it was a terrible, great lion that lay on the side of the shore,'\n",
       "\\item 'under the shade of a piece of the hill that hung as it were a little'\n",
       "\\item 'over him. “Xury,” says I, “you shall on shore and kill him.” Xury,'\n",
       "\\item 'looked frighted, and said, “Me kill! he eat me at one mouth!”—one'\n",
       "\\item 'mouthful he meant. However, I said no more to the boy, but bade him lie'\n",
       "\\item 'still, and I took our biggest gun, which was almost musket-bore, and'\n",
       "\\item 'loaded it with a good charge of powder, and with two slugs, and laid it'\n",
       "\\item 'down; then I loaded another gun with two bullets; and the third (for we'\n",
       "\\item 'had three pieces) I loaded with five smaller bullets. I took the best'\n",
       "\\item 'aim I could with the first piece to have shot him in the head, but he'\n",
       "\\item 'lay so with his leg raised a little above his nose, that the slugs hit'\n",
       "\\item 'his leg about the knee and broke the bone. He started up, growling at'\n",
       "\\item 'first, but finding his leg broken, fell down again; and then got upon'\n",
       "\\item 'three legs, and gave the most hideous roar that ever I heard. I was a'\n",
       "\\item 'little surprised that I had not hit him on the head; however, I took up'\n",
       "\\item 'the second piece immediately, and though he began to move off, fired'\n",
       "\\item 'again, and shot him in the head, and had the pleasure to see him drop'\n",
       "\\item 'and make but little noise, but lie struggling for life. Then Xury took'\n",
       "\\item 'heart, and would have me let him go on shore. “Well, go,” said I: so'\n",
       "\\item 'the boy jumped into the water and taking a little gun in one hand, swam'\n",
       "\\item 'to shore with the other hand, and coming close to the creature, put the'\n",
       "\\item 'muzzle of the piece to his ear, and shot him in the head again, which'\n",
       "\\item 'despatched him quite.'\n",
       "\\item 'This was game indeed to us, but this was no food; and I was very sorry'\n",
       "\\item 'to lose three charges of powder and shot upon a creature that was good'\n",

       "\\item 'said I. “Me cut off his head,” said he. However, Xury could not cut off'\n",

BUILDS A HOUSE—THE JOURNAL'</li><li>'September 30, 1659.—I, poor miserable Robinson Crusoe, being'</li><li>'shipwrecked during a dreadful storm in the offing, came on shore on'</li><li>'this dismal, unfortunate island, which I called “The Island of'</li><li>'Despair”; all the rest of the ship’s company being drowned, and myself'</li><li>'almost dead.'</li><li>'All the rest of the day I spent in afflicting myself at the dismal'</li><li>'circumstances I was brought to—viz. I had neither food, house, clothes,'</li><li>'weapon, nor place to fly to; and in despair of any relief, saw nothing'</li><li>'but death before me—either that I should be devoured by wild beasts,'</li><li>'murdered by savages, or starved to death for want of food. At the'</li><li>'approach of night I slept in a tree, for fear of wild creatures; but'</li><li>'slept soundly, though it rained all night.'</li><li>'_October_ 1.—In the morning I saw, to my great surprise, the ship had'</li><li>'floated with the high tide, and was driven on shore again much nearer'</li><li>'the island; which, as it was some comfort, on one hand—for, seeing her'</li><li>'set upright, and not broken to pieces, I hoped, if the wind abated, I'</li><li>'might get on board, and get some food and necessaries out of her for my'</li><li>'relief—so, on the other hand, it renewed my grief at the loss of my'</li><li>'comrades, who, I imagined, if we had all stayed on board, might have'</li><li>'saved the ship, or, at least, that they would not have been all drowned'</li><li>'as they were; and that, had the men been saved, we might perhaps have'</li><li>'built us a boat out of the ruins of the ship to have carried us to some'</li><li>'other part of the world. I spent great part of this day in perplexing'</li><li>'myself on these things; but at length, seeing the ship almost dry, I'</li><li>'went upon the sand as near as I could, and then swam on board. This day'</li><li>'also it continued raining, though with no wind at all.'</li><li>'_From the 1st of October to the 24th_.—All these days entirely spent in'</li><li>'many several voyages to get all I could out of the ship, which I'</li><li>'brought on shore every tide of flood upon rafts. Much rain also in the'</li><li>'days, though with some intervals of fair weather; but it seems this was'</li><li>'the rainy season.'</li><li>'_Oct._ 20.—I overset my raft, and all the goods I had got upon it; but,'</li><li>'being in shoal water, and the things being chiefly heavy, I recovered'</li><li>'many of them when the tide was out.'</li><li>'_Oct._ 25.—It rained all night and all day, with some gusts of wind;'</li><li>'during which time the ship broke in pieces, the wind blowing a little'</li><li>'harder than before, and was no more to be seen, except the wreck of'</li><li>'her, and that only at low water. I spent this day in covering and'</li><li>'securing the goods which I had saved, that the rain might not spoil'</li><li>'them.'</li><li>'_Oct._ 26.—I walked about the shore almost all day, to find out a place'</li><li>'to fix my habitation, greatly concerned to secure myself from any'</li><li>'attack in the night, either from wild beasts or men. Towards night, I'</li><li>'fixed upon a proper place, under a rock, and marked out a semicircle'</li><li>'for my encampment; which I resolved to strengthen with a work, wall, or'</li><li>'fortification, made of double piles, lined within with cables, and'</li><li>'without with turf.'</li><li>'From the 26th to the 30th I worked very hard in carrying all my goods'</li><li>'to my new habitation, though some part of the time it rained'</li><li>'exceedingly hard.'</li><li>'The 31st, in the morning, I went out into the island with my gun, to'</li><li>'seek for some food, and discover the country; when I killed a she-goat,'</li><li>'and her kid followed me home, which I afterwards killed also, because'</li><li>'it would not feed.'</li><li>'_November_ 1.—I set up my tent under a rock, and lay there for the'</li><li>'first night; making it as large as I could, with stakes driven in to'</li><li>'swing my hammock upon.'</li><li>'_Nov._ 2.—I set up all my chests and boards, and the pieces of timber'</li><li>'which made my rafts, and with them formed a fence round me, a little'</li><li>'within the place I had marked out for my fortification.'</li><li>'_Nov._ 3.—I went out with my gun, and killed two fowls like ducks,'</li><li>'which were very good food. In the afternoon went to work to make me a'</li><li>'table.'</li><li>'_Nov_. 4.—This morning I began to order my times of work, of going out'</li><li>'with my gun, time of sleep, and time of diversion—viz. every morning I'</li><li>'walked out with my gun for two or three hours, if it did not rain; then'</li><li>'employed myself to work till about eleven o’clock; then eat what I had'</li><li>'to live on; and from twelve to two I lay down to sleep, the weather'</li><li>'being excessively hot; and then, in the evening, to work again. The'</li><li>'working part of this day and of the next were wholly employed in making'</li><li>'my table, for I was yet but a very sorry workman, though time and'</li><li>'necessity made me a complete natural mechanic soon after, as I believe'</li><li>'they would do any one else.'</li><li>'_Nov._ 5.—This day went abroad with my gun and my dog, and killed a'</li><li>'wild cat; her skin pretty soft, but her flesh good for nothing; every'</li><li>'creature that I killed I took of the skins and preserved them. Coming'</li><li>'back by the sea-shore, I saw many sorts of sea-fowls, which I did not'</li><li>'understand; but was surprised, and almost frightened, with two or three'</li><li>'seals, which, while I was gazing at, not well knowing what they were,'</li><li>'got into the sea, and escaped me for that time.'</li><li>'_Nov._ 6.—After my morning walk I went to work with my table again, and'</li><li>'finished it, though not to my liking; nor was it long before I learned'</li><li>'to mend it.'</li><li>'_Nov._ 7.—Now it began to be settled fair weather. The 7th, 8th, 9th,'</li><li>'10th, and part of the 12th (for the 11th was Sunday) I took wholly up'</li><li>'to make me a chair, and with much ado brought it to a tolerable shape,'</li><li>'but never to please me; and even in the making I pulled it in pieces'</li><li>'several times.'</li><li>'_Note_.—I soon neglected my keeping Sundays; for, omitting my mark for'</li><li>'them on my post, I forgot which was which.'</li><li>'_Nov._ 13.—This day it rained, which refreshed me exceedingly, and'</li><li>'cooled the earth; but it was accompanied with terrible thunder and'</li><li>'lightning, which frightened me dreadfully, for fear of my powder. As'</li><li>'soon as it was over, I resolved to separate my stock of powder into as'</li><li>'many little parcels as possible, that it might not be in danger.'</li><li>'_Nov._ 14, 15, 16.—These three days I spent in making little square'</li><li>'chests, or boxes, which might hold about a pound, or two pounds at'</li><li>'most, of powder; and so, putting the powder in, I stowed it in places'</li><li>'as secure and remote from one another as possible. On one of these'</li><li>'three days I killed a large bird that was good to eat, but I knew not'</li><li>'what to call it.'</li><li>'_Nov._ 17.—This day I began to dig behind my tent into the rock, to'</li><li>'make room for my further conveniency.'</li><li>'_Note_.—Three things I wanted exceedingly for this work—viz. a pickaxe,'</li><li>'a shovel, and a wheelbarrow or basket; so I desisted from my work, and'</li><li>'began to consider how to supply that want, and make me some tools. As'</li><li>'for the pickaxe, I made use of the iron crows, which were proper'</li><li>'enough, though heavy; but the next thing was a shovel or spade; this'</li><li>'was so absolutely necessary, that, indeed, I could do nothing'</li><li>'effectually without it; but what kind of one to make I knew not.'</li><li>'_Nov._ 18.—The next day, in searching the woods, I found a tree of that'</li><li>'wood, or like it, which in the Brazils they call the iron-tree, for its'</li><li>'exceeding hardness. Of this, with great labour, and almost spoiling my'</li><li>'axe, I cut a piece, and brought it home, too, with difficulty enough,'</li><li>'for it was exceeding heavy. The excessive hardness of the wood, and my'</li><li>'having no other way, made me a long while upon this machine, for I'</li><li>'worked it effectually by little and little into the form of a shovel or'</li><li>'spade; the handle exactly shaped like ours in England, only that the'</li><li>'board part having no iron shod upon it at bottom, it would not last me'</li><li>'so long; however, it served well enough for the uses which I had'</li><li>'occasion to put it to; but never was a shovel, I believe, made after'</li><li>'that fashion, or so long in making.'</li><li>'I was still deficient, for I wanted a basket or a wheelbarrow. A basket'</li><li>'I could not make by any means, having no such things as twigs that'</li><li>'would bend to make wicker-ware—at least, none yet found out; and as to'</li><li>'a wheelbarrow, I fancied I could make all but the wheel; but that I had'</li><li>'no notion of; neither did I know how to go about it; besides, I had no'</li><li>'possible way to make the iron gudgeons for the spindle or axis of the'</li><li>'wheel to run in; so I gave it over, and so, for carrying away the earth'</li><li>'which I dug out of the cave, I made me a thing like a hod which the'</li><li>'labourers carry mortar in when they serve the bricklayers. This was not'</li><li>'so difficult to me as the making the shovel: and yet this and the'</li><li>'shovel, and the attempt which I made in vain to make a wheelbarrow,'</li><li>'took me up no less than four days—I mean always excepting my morning'</li><li>'walk with my gun, which I seldom failed, and very seldom failed also'</li><li>'bringing home something fit to eat.'</li><li>'_Nov._ 23.—My other work having now stood still, because of my making'</li><li>'these tools, when they were finished I went on, and working every day,'</li><li>'as my strength and time allowed, I spent eighteen days entirely in'</li><li>'widening and deepening my cave, that it might hold my goods'</li><li>'commodiously.'</li><li>'_Note_.—During all this time I worked to make this room or cave'</li><li>'spacious enough to accommodate me as a warehouse or magazine, a'</li><li>'kitchen, a dining-room, and a cellar. As for my lodging, I kept to the'</li><li>'tent; except that sometimes, in the wet season of the year, it rained'</li><li>'so hard that I could not keep myself dry, which caused me afterwards to'</li><li>'cover all my place within my pale with long poles, in the form of'</li><li>'rafters, leaning against the rock, and load them with flags and large'</li><li>'leaves of trees, like a thatch.'</li><li>'_December_ 10.—I began now to think my cave or vault finished, when on'</li><li>'a sudden (it seems I had made it too large) a great quantity of earth'</li><li>'fell down from the top on one side; so much that, in short, it frighted'</li><li>'me, and not without reason, too, for if I had been under it, I had'</li><li>'never wanted a gravedigger. I had now a great deal of work to do over'</li><li>'again, for I had the loose earth to carry out; and, which was of more'</li><li>'importance, I had the ceiling to prop up, so that I might be sure no'</li><li>'more would come down.'</li><li>'_Dec_. 11.—This day I went to work with it accordingly, and got two'</li><li>'shores or posts pitched upright to the top, with two pieces of boards'</li><li>'across over each post; this I finished the next day; and setting more'</li><li>'posts up with boards, in about a week more I had the roof secured, and'</li><li>'the posts, standing in rows, served me for partitions to part off the'</li><li>'house.'</li><li>'_Dec._ 17.—From this day to the 20th I placed shelves, and knocked up'</li><li>'nails on the posts, to hang everything up that could be hung up; and'</li><li>'now I began to be in some order within doors.'</li><li>'_Dec._ 20.—Now I carried everything into the cave, and began to furnish'</li><li>'my house, and set up some pieces of boards like a dresser, to order my'</li><li>'victuals upon; but boards began to be very scarce with me; also, I made'</li><li>'me another table.'</li><li>'_Dec._ 24.—Much rain all night and all day. No stirring out.'</li><li>'_Dec._ 25.—Rain all day.'</li><li>'_Dec._ 26.—No rain, and the earth much cooler than before, and'</li><li>'pleasanter.'</li><li>'_Dec._ 27.—Killed a young goat, and lamed another, so that I caught it'</li><li>'and led it home in a string; when I had it at home, I bound and'</li><li>'splintered up its leg, which was broke.'</li><li>'_N.B._—I took such care of it that it lived, and the leg grew well and'</li><li>'as strong as ever; but, by my nursing it so long, it grew tame, and fed'</li><li>'upon the little green at my door, and would not go away. This was the'</li><li>'first time that I entertained a thought of breeding up some tame'</li><li>'creatures, that I might have food when my powder and shot was all'</li><li>'spent.'</li><li>'_Dec._ 28, 29, 30.—Great heats and no breeze, so that there was no'</li><li>'stirring abroad except in the evening for food; this time I spent in'</li><li>'putting all my things in order within doors.'</li><li>'_January_ 1.—Very hot still: but I went abroad early and late with my'</li><li>'gun, and lay still in the middle of the day. This evening, going'</li><li>'farther into the valleys which lay towards the centre of the island, I'</li><li>'found there were plenty of goats, though exceedingly shy, and hard to'</li><li>'come at; however, I resolved to try if I could not bring my dog to hunt'</li><li>'them down.'</li><li>'_Jan._ 2.—Accordingly, the next day I went out with my dog, and set him'</li><li>'upon the goats, but I was mistaken, for they all faced about upon the'</li><li>'dog, and he knew his danger too well, for he would not come near them.'</li><li>'_Jan._ 3.—I began my fence or wall; which, being still jealous of my'</li><li>'being attacked by somebody, I resolved to make very thick and strong.'</li><li>'_N.B._—This wall being described before, I purposely omit what was said'</li><li>'in the journal; it is sufficient to observe, that I was no less time'</li><li>...</li><li>'but I could never arrive at the capacity of making one by them, though'</li><li>'I spent many weeks about it; I could neither put in the heads, or join'</li><li>'the staves so true to one another as to make them hold water; so I gave'</li><li>'that also over. In the next place, I was at a great loss for candles;'</li><li>'so that as soon as ever it was dark, which was generally by seven'</li><li>'o’clock, I was obliged to go to bed. I remembered the lump of beeswax'</li><li>'with which I made candles in my African adventure; but I had none of'</li><li>'that now; the only remedy I had was, that when I had killed a goat I'</li><li>'saved the tallow, and with a little dish made of clay, which I baked in'</li><li>'the sun, to which I added a wick of some oakum, I made me a lamp; and'</li><li>'this gave me light, though not a clear, steady light, like a candle. In'</li><li>'the middle of all my labours it happened that, rummaging my things, I'</li><li>'found a little bag which, as I hinted before, had been filled with corn'</li><li>'for the feeding of poultry—not for this voyage, but before, as I'</li><li>'suppose, when the ship came from Lisbon. The little remainder of corn'</li><li>'that had been in the bag was all devoured by the rats, and I saw'</li><li>'nothing in the bag but husks and dust; and being willing to have the'</li><li>'bag for some other use (I think it was to put powder in, when I divided'</li><li>'it for fear of the lightning, or some such use), I shook the husks of'</li><li>'corn out of it on one side of my fortification, under the rock.'</li><li>'It was a little before the great rains just now mentioned that I threw'</li><li>'this stuff away, taking no notice, and not so much as remembering that'</li><li>'I had thrown anything there, when, about a month after, or thereabouts,'</li><li>'I saw some few stalks of something green shooting out of the ground,'</li><li>'which I fancied might be some plant I had not seen; but I was'</li><li>'surprised, and perfectly astonished, when, after a little longer time,'</li><li>'I saw about ten or twelve ears come out, which were perfect green'</li><li>'barley, of the same kind as our European—nay, as our English barley.'</li><li>'It is impossible to express the astonishment and confusion of my'</li><li>'thoughts on this occasion. I had hitherto acted upon no religious'</li><li>'foundation at all; indeed, I had very few notions of religion in my'</li><li>'head, nor had entertained any sense of anything that had befallen me'</li><li>'otherwise than as chance, or, as we lightly say, what pleases God,'</li><li>'without so much as inquiring into the end of Providence in these'</li><li>'things, or His order in governing events for the world. But after I saw'</li><li>'barley grow there, in a climate which I knew was not proper for corn,'</li><li>'and especially that I knew not how it came there, it startled me'</li><li>'strangely, and I began to suggest that God had miraculously caused His'</li><li>'grain to grow without any help of seed sown, and that it was so'</li><li>'directed purely for my sustenance on that wild, miserable place.'</li><li>'This touched my heart a little, and brought tears out of my eyes, and I'</li><li>'began to bless myself that such a prodigy of nature should happen upon'</li><li>'my account; and this was the more strange to me, because I saw near it'</li><li>'still, all along by the side of the rock, some other straggling stalks,'</li><li>'which proved to be stalks of rice, and which I knew, because I had seen'</li><li>'it grow in Africa when I was ashore there.'</li><li>'I not only thought these the pure productions of Providence for my'</li><li>'support, but not doubting that there was more in the place, I went all'</li><li>'over that part of the island, where I had been before, peering in every'</li><li>'corner, and under every rock, to see for more of it, but I could not'</li><li>'find any. At last it occurred to my thoughts that I shook a bag of'</li><li>'chickens’ meat out in that place; and then the wonder began to cease;'</li><li>'and I must confess my religious thankfulness to God’s providence began'</li><li>'to abate, too, upon the discovering that all this was nothing but what'</li><li>'was common; though I ought to have been as thankful for so strange and'</li><li>'unforeseen a providence as if it had been miraculous; for it was really'</li><li>'the work of Providence to me, that should order or appoint that ten or'</li><li>'twelve grains of corn should remain unspoiled, when the rats had'</li><li>'destroyed all the rest, as if it had been dropped from heaven; as also,'</li><li>'that I should throw it out in that particular place, where, it being in'</li><li>'the shade of a high rock, it sprang up immediately; whereas, if I had'</li><li>'thrown it anywhere else at that time, it had been burnt up and'</li><li>'destroyed.'</li><li>'I carefully saved the ears of this corn, you may be sure, in their'</li><li>'season, which was about the end of June; and, laying up every corn, I'</li><li>'resolved to sow them all again, hoping in time to have some quantity'</li><li>'sufficient to supply me with bread. But it was not till the fourth year'</li><li>'that I could allow myself the least grain of this corn to eat, and even'</li><li>'then but sparingly, as I shall say afterwards, in its order; for I lost'</li><li>'all that I sowed the first season by not observing the proper time; for'</li><li>'I sowed it just before the dry season, so that it never came up at all,'</li><li>'at least not as it would have done; of which in its place.'</li><li>'Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or thirty stalks of'</li><li>'rice, which I preserved with the same care and for the same use, or to'</li><li>'the same purpose—to make me bread, or rather food; for I found ways to'</li><li>'cook it without baking, though I did that also after some time.'</li><li>'But to return to my Journal.'</li><li>'I worked excessive hard these three or four months to get my wall done;'</li><li>'and the 14th of April I closed it up, contriving to go into it, not by'</li><li>'a door but over the wall, by a ladder, that there might be no sign on'</li><li>'the outside of my habitation.'</li><li>'_April_ 16.—I finished the ladder; so I went up the ladder to the top,'</li><li>'and then pulled it up after me, and let it down in the inside. This was'</li><li>'a complete enclosure to me; for within I had room enough, and nothing'</li><li>'could come at me from without, unless it could first mount my wall.'</li><li>'The very next day after this wall was finished I had almost had all my'</li><li>'labour overthrown at once, and myself killed. The case was thus: As I'</li><li>'was busy in the inside, behind my tent, just at the entrance into my'</li><li>'cave, I was terribly frighted with a most dreadful, surprising thing'</li><li>'indeed; for all on a sudden I found the earth come crumbling down from'</li><li>'the roof of my cave, and from the edge of the hill over my head, and'</li><li>'two of the posts I had set up in the cave cracked in a frightful'</li><li>'manner. I was heartily scared; but thought nothing of what was really'</li><li>'the cause, only thinking that the top of my cave was fallen in, as some'</li><li>'of it had done before: and for fear I should be buried in it I ran'</li><li>'forward to my ladder, and not thinking myself safe there neither, I got'</li><li>'over my wall for fear of the pieces of the hill, which I expected might'</li><li>'roll down upon me. I had no sooner stepped down upon the firm ground,'</li><li>'than I plainly saw it was a terrible earthquake, for the ground I stood'</li><li>'on shook three times at about eight minutes’ distance, with three such'</li><li>'shocks as would have overturned the strongest building that could be'</li><li>'supposed to have stood on the earth; and a great piece of the top of a'</li><li>'rock which stood about half a mile from me next the sea fell down with'</li><li>'such a terrible noise as I never heard in all my life. I perceived also'</li><li>'the very sea was put into violent motion by it; and I believe the'</li><li>'shocks were stronger under the water than on the island.'</li><li>'I was so much amazed with the thing itself, having never felt the like,'</li><li>'nor discoursed with any one that had, that I was like one dead or'</li><li>'stupefied; and the motion of the earth made my stomach sick, like one'</li><li>'that was tossed at sea; but the noise of the falling of the rock'</li><li>'awakened me, as it were, and rousing me from the stupefied condition I'</li><li>'was in, filled me with horror; and I thought of nothing then but the'</li><li>'hill falling upon my tent and all my household goods, and burying all'</li><li>'at once; and this sunk my very soul within me a second time.'</li><li>'After the third shock was over, and I felt no more for some time, I'</li><li>'began to take courage; and yet I had not heart enough to go over my'</li><li>'wall again, for fear of being buried alive, but sat still upon the'</li><li>'ground greatly cast down and disconsolate, not knowing what to do. All'</li><li>'this while I had not the least serious religious thought; nothing but'</li><li>'the common “Lord have mercy upon me!” and when it was over that went'</li><li>'away too.'</li><li>'While I sat thus, I found the air overcast and grow cloudy, as if it'</li><li>'would rain. Soon after that the wind arose by little and little, so'</li><li>'that in less than half-an-hour it blew a most dreadful hurricane; the'</li><li>'sea was all on a sudden covered over with foam and froth; the shore was'</li><li>'covered with the breach of the water, the trees were torn up by the'</li><li>'roots, and a terrible storm it was. This held about three hours, and'</li><li>'then began to abate; and in two hours more it was quite calm, and began'</li><li>'to rain very hard. All this while I sat upon the ground very much'</li><li>'terrified and dejected; when on a sudden it came into my thoughts, that'</li><li>'these winds and rain being the consequences of the earthquake, the'</li><li>'earthquake itself was spent and over, and I might venture into my cave'</li><li>'again. With this thought my spirits began to revive; and the rain also'</li><li>'helping to persuade me, I went in and sat down in my tent. But the rain'</li><li>'was so violent that my tent was ready to be beaten down with it; and I'</li><li>'was forced to go into my cave, though very much afraid and uneasy, for'</li><li>'fear it should fall on my head. This violent rain forced me to a new'</li><li>'work—viz. to cut a hole through my new fortification, like a sink, to'</li><li>'let the water go out, which would else have flooded my cave. After I'</li><li>'had been in my cave for some time, and found still no more shocks of'</li><li>'the earthquake follow, I began to be more composed. And now, to support'</li><li>'my spirits, which indeed wanted it very much, I went to my little'</li><li>'store, and took a small sup of rum; which, however, I did then and'</li><li>'always very sparingly, knowing I could have no more when that was gone.'</li><li>'It continued raining all that night and great part of the next day, so'</li><li>'that I could not stir abroad; but my mind being more composed, I began'</li><li>'to think of what I had best do; concluding that if the island was'</li><li>'subject to these earthquakes, there would be no living for me in a'</li><li>'cave, but I must consider of building a little hut in an open place'</li><li>'which I might surround with a wall, as I had done here, and so make'</li><li>'myself secure from wild beasts or men; for I concluded, if I stayed'</li><li>'where I was, I should certainly one time or other be buried alive.'</li><li>'With these thoughts, I resolved to remove my tent from the place where'</li><li>'it stood, which was just under the hanging precipice of the hill; and'</li><li>'which, if it should be shaken again, would certainly fall upon my tent;'</li><li>'and I spent the two next days, being the 19th and 20th of April, in'</li><li>'contriving where and how to remove my habitation. The fear of being'</li><li>'swallowed up alive made me that I never slept in quiet; and yet the'</li><li>'apprehension of lying abroad without any fence was almost equal to it;'</li><li>'but still, when I looked about, and saw how everything was put in'</li><li>'order, how pleasantly concealed I was, and how safe from danger, it'</li><li>'made me very loath to remove. In the meantime, it occurred to me that'</li><li>'it would require a vast deal of time for me to do this, and that I must'</li><li>'be contented to venture where I was, till I had formed a camp for'</li><li>'myself, and had secured it so as to remove to it. So with this'</li><li>'resolution I composed myself for a time, and resolved that I would go'</li><li>'to work with all speed to build me a wall with piles and cables, &amp;c.,'</li><li>'in a circle, as before, and set my tent up in it when it was finished;'</li><li>'but that I would venture to stay where I was till it was finished, and'</li><li>'fit to remove. This was the 21st.'</li><li>'_April_ 22.—The next morning I begin to consider of means to put this'</li><li>'resolve into execution; but I was at a great loss about my tools. I had'</li><li>'three large axes, and abundance of hatchets (for we carried the'</li><li>'hatchets for traffic with the Indians); but with much chopping and'</li><li>'cutting knotty hard wood, they were all full of notches, and dull; and'</li><li>'though I had a grindstone, I could not turn it and grind my tools too.'</li><li>'This cost me as much thought as a statesman would have bestowed upon a'</li><li>'grand point of politics, or a judge upon the life and death of a man.'</li><li>'At length I contrived a wheel with a string, to turn it with my foot,'</li><li>'that I might have both my hands at liberty. _Note_.—I had never seen'</li><li>'any such thing in England, or at least, not to take notice how it was'</li><li>'done, though since I have observed, it is very common there; besides'</li><li>'that, my grindstone was very large and heavy. This machine cost me a'</li><li>'full week’s work to bring it to perfection.'</li><li>'_April_ 28, 29.—These two whole days I took up in grinding my tools, my'</li><li>'machine for turning my grindstone performing very well.'</li><li>'_April_ 30.—Having perceived my bread had been low a great while, now I'</li><li>'took a survey of it, and reduced myself to one biscuit cake a day,'</li><li>'which made my heart very heavy.'</li><li>'_May_ 1.—In the morning, looking towards the sea side, the tide being'</li><li>'low, I saw something lie on the shore bigger than ordinary, and it'</li><li>'looked like a cask; when I came to it, I found a small barrel, and two'</li><li>'or three pieces of the wreck of the ship, which were driven on shore by'</li><li>'the late hurricane; and looking towards the wreck itself, I thought it'</li><li>'seemed to lie higher out of the water than it used to do. I examined'</li><li>'the barrel which was driven on shore, and soon found it was a barrel of'</li><li>'gunpowder; but it had taken water, and the powder was caked as hard as'</li><li>'a stone; however, I rolled it farther on shore for the present, and'</li><li>'went on upon the sands, as near as I could to the wreck of the ship, to'</li><li>'look for more.'</li></ol>\n"

       "\\item 'for the pickaxe, I made use of the iron crows, which were proper'\n",

       "\\item 'effectually without it; but what kind of one to make I knew not.'\n",
       "\\item '\\_Nov.\\_ 18.—The next day, in searching the woods, I found a tree of that'\n",
       "\\item 'wood, or like it, which in the Brazils they call the iron-tree, for its'\n",
       "\\item 'exceeding hardness. Of this, with great labour, and almost spoiling my'\n",
       "\\item 'axe, I cut a piece, and brought it home, too, with difficulty enough,'\n",
       "\\item 'for it was exceeding heavy. The excessive hardness of the wood, and my'\n",
       "\\item 'having no other way, made me a long while upon this machine, for I'\n",
       "\\item 'worked it effectually by little and little into the form of a shovel or'\n",
       "\\item 'spade; the handle exactly shaped like ours in England, only that the'\n",
       "\\item 'board part having no iron shod upon it at bottom, it would not last me'\n",
       "\\item 'so long; however, it served well enough for the uses which I had'\n",
       "\\item 'occasion to put it to; but never was a shovel, I believe, made after'\n",
       "\\item 'that fashion, or so long in making.'\n",
       "\\item 'I was still deficient, for I wanted a basket or a wheelbarrow. A basket'\n",
       "\\item 'I could not make by any means, having no such things as twigs that'\n",
       "\\item 'would bend to make wicker-ware—at least, none yet found out; and as to'\n",
       "\\item 'a wheelbarrow, I fancied I could make all but the wheel; but that I had'\n",
       "\\item 'no notion of; neither did I know how to go about it; besides, I had no'\n",
       "\\item 'possible way to make the iron gudgeons for the spindle or axis of the'\n",
       "\\item 'wheel to run in; so I gave it over, and so, for carrying away the earth'\n",
       "\\item 'which I dug out of the cave, I made me a thing like a hod which the'\n",
       "\\item 'labourers carry mortar in when they serve the bricklayers. This was not'\n",
       "\\item 'so difficult to me as the making the shovel: and yet this and the'\n",
       "\\item 'shovel, and the attempt which I made in vain to make a wheelbarrow,'\n",
       "\\item 'took me up no less than four days—I mean always excepting my morning'\n",
       "\\item 'walk with my gun, which I seldom failed, and very seldom failed also'\n",
       "\\item 'bringing home something fit to eat.'\n",
       "\\item '\\_Nov.\\_ 23.—My other work having now stood still, because of my making'\n",
       "\\item 'these tools, when they were finished I went on, and working every day,'\n",
       "\\item 'as my strength and time allowed, I spent eighteen days entirely in'\n",
       "\\item 'widening and deepening my cave, that it might hold my goods'\n",
       "\\item 'commodiously.'\n",
       "\\item '\\_Note\\_.—During all this time I worked to make this room or cave'\n",
       "\\item 'spacious enough to accommodate me as a warehouse or magazine, a'\n",
       "\\item 'kitchen, a dining-room, and a cellar. As for my lodging, I kept to the'\n",
       "\\item 'tent; except that sometimes, in the wet season of the year, it rained'\n",
       "\\item 'so hard that I could not keep myself dry, which caused me afterwards to'\n",
       "\\item 'cover all my place within my pale with long poles, in the form of'\n",
       "\\item 'rafters, leaning against the rock, and load them with flags and large'\n",
       "\\item 'leaves of trees, like a thatch.'\n",
       "\\item '\\_December\\_ 10.—I began now to think my cave or vault finished, when on'\n",
       "\\item 'a sudden (it seems I had made it too large) a great quantity of earth'\n",
       "\\item 'fell down from the top on one side; so much that, in short, it frighted'\n",
       "\\item 'me, and not without reason, too, for if I had been under it, I had'\n",
       "\\item 'never wanted a gravedigger. I had now a great deal of work to do over'\n",
       "\\item 'again, for I had the loose earth to carry out; and, which was of more'\n",
       "\\item 'importance, I had the ceiling to prop up, so that I might be sure no'\n",
       "\\item 'more would come down.'\n",

       "\\item 'barley grow there, in a climate which I knew was not proper for corn,'\n",
       "\\item 'and especially that I knew not how it came there, it startled me'\n",
       "\\item 'strangely, and I began to suggest that God had miraculously caused His'\n",

       "\\item 'directed purely for my sustenance on that wild, miserable place.'\n",
       "\\item 'This touched my heart a little, and brought tears out of my eyes, and I'\n",

       "\\item 'resolved to sow them all again, hoping in time to have some quantity'\n",
       "\\item 'sufficient to supply me with bread. But it was not till the fourth year'\n",
       "\\item 'that I could allow myself the least grain of this corn to eat, and even'\n",
       "\\item 'then but sparingly, as I shall say afterwards, in its order; for I lost'\n",

       "\\item 'and the 14th of April I closed it up, contriving to go into it, not by'\n",

       "\\item '\\_April\\_ 16.—I finished the ladder; so I went up the ladder to the top,'\n",

       "\\item 'roll down upon me. I had no sooner stepped down upon the firm ground,'\n",
       "\\item 'than I plainly saw it was a terrible earthquake, for the ground I stood'\n",
       "\\item 'on shook three times at about eight minutes’ distance, with three such'\n",
       "\\item 'shocks as would have overturned the strongest building that could be'\n",
       "\\item 'supposed to have stood on the earth; and a great piece of the top of a'\n",
       "\\item 'rock which stood about half a mile from me next the sea fell down with'\n",
       "\\item 'such a terrible noise as I never heard in all my life. I perceived also'\n",
       "\\item 'the very sea was put into violent motion by it; and I believe the'\n",

       "\\item 'stupefied; and the motion of the earth made my stomach sick, like one'\n",
       "\\item 'that was tossed at sea; but the noise of the falling of the rock'\n",
       "\\item 'awakened me, as it were, and rousing me from the stupefied condition I'\n",

       "\\item 'at once; and this sunk my very soul within me a second time.'\n",
       "\\item 'After the third shock was over, and I felt no more for some time, I'\n",
       "\\item 'began to take courage; and yet I had not heart enough to go over my'\n",

       "\\item 'this while I had not the least serious religious thought; nothing but'\n",
       "\\item 'the common “Lord have mercy upon me!” and when it was over that went'\n",
       "\\item 'away too.'\n",
       "\\item 'While I sat thus, I found the air overcast and grow cloudy, as if it'\n",
       "\\item 'would rain. Soon after that the wind arose by little and little, so'\n",
       "\\item 'that in less than half-an-hour it blew a most dreadful hurricane; the'\n",
       "\\item 'sea was all on a sudden covered over with foam and froth; the shore was'\n",
       "\\item 'covered with the breach of the water, the trees were torn up by the'\n",
       "\\item 'roots, and a terrible storm it was. This held about three hours, and'\n",
       "\\item 'then began to abate; and in two hours more it was quite calm, and began'\n",
       "\\item 'to rain very hard. All this while I sat upon the ground very much'\n",
       "\\item 'terrified and dejected; when on a sudden it came into my thoughts, that'\n",

       "\\item 'earthquake itself was spent and over, and I might venture into my cave'\n",
       "\\item 'again. With this thought my spirits began to revive; and the rain also'\n",
       "\\item 'helping to persuade me, I went in and sat down in my tent. But the rain'\n",
       "\\item 'was so violent that my tent was ready to be beaten down with it; and I'\n",
       "\\item 'was forced to go into my cave, though very much afraid and uneasy, for'\n",
       "\\item 'fear it should fall on my head. This violent rain forced me to a new'\n",
       "\\item 'work—viz. to cut a hole through my new fortification, like a sink, to'\n",
       "\\item 'let the water go out, which would else have flooded my cave. After I'\n",
       "\\item 'had been in my cave for some time, and found still no more shocks of'\n",
       "\\item 'the earthquake follow, I began to be more composed. And now, to support'\n",
       "\\item 'my spirits, which indeed wanted it very much, I went to my little'\n",
       "\\item 'store, and took a small sup of rum; which, however, I did then and'\n",
       "\\item 'always very sparingly, knowing I could have no more when that was gone.'\n",
       "\\item 'It continued raining all that night and great part of the next day, so'\n",
       "\\item 'that I could not stir abroad; but my mind being more composed, I began'\n",
       "\\item 'to think of what I had best do; concluding that if the island was'\n",
       "\\item 'subject to these earthquakes, there would be no living for me in a'\n",
       "\\item 'cave, but I must consider of building a little hut in an open place'\n",
       "\\item 'which I might surround with a wall, as I had done here, and so make'\n",
       "\\item 'myself secure from wild beasts or men; for I concluded, if I stayed'\n",
       "\\item 'where I was, I should certainly one time or other be buried alive.'\n",
       "\\item 'With these thoughts, I resolved to remove my tent from the place where'\n",
       "\\item 'it stood, which was just under the hanging precipice of the hill; and'\n",
       "\\item 'which, if it should be shaken again, would certainly fall upon my tent;'\n",
       "\\item 'and I spent the two next days, being the 19th and 20th of April, in'\n",
       "\\item 'contriving where and how to remove my habitation. The fear of being'\n",
       "\\item 'swallowed up alive made me that I never slept in quiet; and yet the'\n",
       "\\item 'apprehension of lying abroad without any fence was almost equal to it;'\n",
       "\\item 'but still, when I looked about, and saw how everything was put in'\n",
       "\\item 'order, how pleasantly concealed I was, and how safe from danger, it'\n",
       "\\item 'made me very loath to remove. In the meantime, it occurred to me that'\n",

    "\n",
    "Cosine similarity is commonly used to measure the similarity of text data such as words, sentences, and documents, and it is expressed similarly to correlation coefficients. Cosine similarity represents the angle between two vectors represented in a vector space, and it can be considered as an uncentralized correlation coefficient between two vectors. Unlike correlation coefficients that can range from -1 to 1, cosine similarity of a document-word matrix ranges from 0 to 1. The values of each element of the two vectors x and y represent the frequency of word occurrence, and they always have non-negative values. Therefore, the numerator of cosine similarity is always non-negative, and the cosine similarity itself also always has non-negative values. When two vectors x and y are identical, the cosine similarity becomes 1 and reaches its maximum value."

    "Looking at the results, we can see that the cosine similarity between chapters 2 and 5 of Robinson Crusoe is 0.630, which is relatively high and suggests that there is some similarity between the two chapters. The cosine similarity is visualized using the corrplot() function from the corrplot package, with blue circles representing the positive values of cosine similarity between the two chapters."
